        <p my-2><em>“The Coding Forum“</em> is an independent online journal-magazine that seeks to widen and deepen our
            conversations on the issues that concern us.</p>
        <p>It is called a journal-magazine because it offers serious analysis, comment and reflection on contemporary
            issues, but it does so in a reader-friendly magazine-like language. <em>“The Coding Forum“</em> is a unique digital
            publication that combines regular updates with a monthly publication. The website publishes a couple of new
            articles every Friday. A monthly issue with a set of 8-10 articles is also put out on the first Friday of
            every month. Most of the articles on <em>“The Coding Forum“</em> are specially commissioned pieces.</p>

        <p>In terms of style and texture, we aim to occupy—and to expand—the vital space between the mainstream media
            and the academic journal.</p>
        <p>A special focus of <em>“The Coding Forum“</em> are university students—undergraduates as well as post-graduates—who seek
            insightful, well-written and easily accessible material on contemporary issues.</p>
        <p>Editors and authors of <em>“The Coding Forum“</em> work together closely to ensure that our articles are substantive and
            yet not dense. The objective is to reach as large an audience as possible. We hope to develop a style that
            respects readers and is as clear and simple as possible without being simplistic.</p>
        <p><em>“The Coding Forum“</em> is a crowd-financed effort initially organised by a group of academics, journalists, and
            writers. It has since appealed to the wider public to make small donations to aid publication. This digital
            publication is not linked in any manner to any industrial, financial or political organisation. The Coding
            Forum appeals to readers to make donations to enable independent publication and to keep access free for
            all. It does not carry advertising in any form.</p>
        <p><em>“The Coding Forum“</em> is published by the Vichar Trust, a public charity. The Trust hopes to engage in a number of
            activities related to education; <em>“The Coding Forum“</em> is its first venture.</p>
